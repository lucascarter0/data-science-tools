# Power Analysis
These scripts compare the statistical power of different hypothesis tests against various distributions and effect sizes. In hypothesis testing, statistical power is a measure of the probability of successfully rejecting a null hypothesis, given one exists. It is the inverse of the probability of a Type II error, which is the probability of accepting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. These tables can be used as part of designing a hypothesis test.

Relevant information contained in the contour plots:
- For a fixed sample size and known distribution, which hypothesis test has the strongest statistical power?
- For a known distribution and expected effect size, how many samples are needed to achieve a desired statistical power?
